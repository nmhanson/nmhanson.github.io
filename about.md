# Who am I?

Hey! I'm currently a super-senior studying Software Engineering at Iowa State.
I will graduate this December if I don't fail any classes! I've had fair amount
of experience with web development; I currently work at Iowa State as a web
developer, and I contributed to a web application with Cerner in Kansas City. I
am not just a web developer though! I have recently become much more interested
in programming as more than just a career, but as a fun hobby and tool for
personal use. 

# Experience

I've had most of my professional experience with web development. I've been
exposed to a regrettable amount of PHP. (Not that I blindly hate PHP, it is just
too easy to write horrible code, in my experience. Not that I ever have. Nope,
not once.) I've recently had the pleasure of working with Ruby on Rails, an MVC
based web application framework for Ruby. Ruby isn't my favorite language, but
RoR has exposed me to some pretty useful pieces of technology, which I found a
lot of enjoyment in learning - for example: dependency management tools (Ruby's
[Bundler]), object-relational-mapping (Ruby's Active Record) and more. I took
what I learned from Ruby on Rails and tried to apply as much as I could to my
work with PHP, and have investigated similar frameworks for PHP (e.g.
[Composer]).

# Interests

Recently, I've taken a strong interest in [Rust], a newer systems language
sponsored by Mozilla which is growing by the day. So far, the learning curve
has been steep, but it has proven to be a fun challenge. Given the amount of web
development I've done, I should be more familiar with JavaScript, so I have
recently taken an interest in teaching myself the useful and unique JavaScript
constructs whenever I have the free time.
