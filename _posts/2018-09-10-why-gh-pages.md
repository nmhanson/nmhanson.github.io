title: Why GitHub Pages?

# Why am I writing this blog post?

Please, one question at a time. I'm admittedly writing this blog post because I
wanted a website, and when I had finally got around to creating one, I was
dissapointed to see that it was barren. How could I be so uninspired? So what
you're reading is just a ficus - something with a little color to elevate the
feng shui of my website. Can't you feel the flow of positive energy? I want to
keep chakras aligned - both yours and mine.

# But couldn't I have made a website that wasn't a blog?

Maybe. But GitHub offered me Github Pages, and Github Pages spoon-fed me
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a really cool Ruby Gem that does almost all the
heavy lifting of setting up a halfway-put-together blogging website. And since I
have almost no design taste and therefore no ability to quickly set up an
attractive website, I ate it up and here we are. Welcome.

Oh, I may use the blogging aspect to showcase some of my personal projects once
they reach a point of maturity where I can be proud of them. You can see their
rotting remains on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nmhanson). *But I will
definitely finish them someday.*

# Okay, so why choose GitHub Pages if I'm restricted to using Jekyll?

Try not to fall out of your chair; the answer is very exciting. You see, I did
not want to register and *pay for* a domain, nor did I want to track down the
hardware to run a web server, especially when that hardware needs to handle the
*sheer volume* of traffic that this website will generate. And paying Amazon to
host my site? And spend *fifty cents per month*? I'm not some fatcat sitting on
piles of half-dollar coins, no thanks. Basically, I wanted it to be free.

And, in all seriousness, It's a pretty cool service offered by GitHub and I got
the opportunity to learn about a cool technology.
